These are notes from a podcast by Joscha Bach available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM). 

**The definition of nerd.**

> Nerds need to interface with the society in non-standard ways. Sometimes, I define a nerd as someone who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer-review. Normal people understand that the purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment and these purposes tend to conflict, which means the nerds have to learn how to  interact with society at large.

> Whatever hapless individual is around you tend to make them, the gift of information. 

Ah! Now, this really hits home. There have been countless instances where I've presented my ideas - the unfortunate things that appear in my head - often with little to no moderation, to whosoever friendly that passes by, with no less that eyes glittering with knowledge and mild angst. {The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, folks!}  And I am often shot back with puzzled faces, shock of non-conformity or blatant rejection of my plausible ignorance. While I am completely comfortable harboring an infactual, inefficient idea, the  world isn't always as open-minded as you wish they'd be. 

*"Just hear me out?"*, *"But it's only my conjecture?"*, *"Hey, this might be improbable, but  it could be one of the possible explanations".* O! Poor nerd, you should know by now, that these phrases aren't tolerated in the general society -  one where loudness of words, skill and brevity of language are tools of negotiating general agreement. Keep your "I agree, but"-s to yourself. Or so I've learnt. 

**Nature of Truth**
