        <h1 class=display-5>About Me</h1>

        <div style="text-align:justify;">
            <p class="">
              I am a graduate management student of data science, currently in my second year of PGDM in Research and Business Analytics at the Madras School of Economics.  My fields of research interests include machine learning, quantum computing and macroeconomics.
            </p>

            <p class="">
              Prior to pursuing a management course, I was a Masters student of physics and have undergone training in areas that include mathematical physics, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. My Masters thesis was on determining the thermo-electric properties and electronic structure using computational methods.

              <p class="">
              Since joining the program at MSE, I've acquired a liking towards the subject of economics. I am currently engaged in modeling the monetary policy response function for RBI's interventions in the foreign exchange market to curb exchange rate volatility.
              </p>

              <p class="">
              In my spare time, I enjoy watching and discussing TV shows with my friends. The Office, 99 and any production by Michael Schur are on my all-weather watch-list. Also, I enjoy xkcd! :)
