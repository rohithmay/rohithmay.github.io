### Some basic ideas in probability 

Consider a pair of fair dice and toss them once. We ask the question - *What kind of distribution do we obtain from tossing a pair of dice?* Consider $s$, denoting the sum of the score on the dice to be a random variable. The sample space of this score: $s = \{2,3,4,â€¦,12\}$. *What is the probability of getting a particular score?* From the conservation of total probability, $ \Sigma_{s=2}^{12} P_s = 1$; where each $P_s\in [0,1]$.

*What is the most probable score?* 7. Because there are six outcomes favorable to this event, which is the  maximum for any event pertaining to the maximum score. 

*What is the probability of getting any score? Say, 3 in die1 and 4 in die2 ?* It is $1/36$, for it's $1/6$ for each die.
