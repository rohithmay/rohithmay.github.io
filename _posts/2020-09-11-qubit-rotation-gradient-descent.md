Some applications of quantum machine learning are enumerated:

1. Logistics. In logistics, there are problems that involve the interaction of several variables - like transportations systems. Quantum computers and quantum algorithms are particularly useful in solving complex combinatorial problems. 
2. Finance. Quantum Computing has already shown to have quadratic speed-ups in Monte Carlo methods that come up in pricing assets and derivatives, risk management, portfolio management and optimization etc., with much scope for innovation. 
3. Material Science. The study of molecules is a very difficult problem with our current hardware and the hope is that quantum computers can handle these difficult computations and simulations in quantum chemistry - with applications in drug design, protein synthesis etc. 
4. The Universe! - Richard Feynman famously quipped that nature is quantum and that any  successful model of nature must incorporate quantum effects, which quantum computing essentially involves. 

> “**Nature** isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of **nature**, you'd better make it **quantum** mechanical, and by golly it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy.” -- Richard Feynman

## What is Quantum Machine Learning?

Researchers often cast quantum and classical computing methods into the following four blocks, based on the data generating system and the data processing device.
