## Where can one apply quantum machine learning algorithms?

Some applications of quantum machine learning are enumerated:

1. Logistics. In logistics, there are problems that involve the interaction of several variables - like transportations systems. Quantum computers and quantum algorithms are particularly useful in solving complex combinatorial problems. 
2. Finance. Quantum Computing has already shown to have quadratic speed-ups in Monte Carlo methods that come up in pricing assets and derivatives, risk management, portfolio management and optimization etc., with much scope for innovation. 
3. Material Science. The study of molecules is a very difficult problem with our current hardware and the hope is that quantum computers can handle these difficult computations and simulations in quantum chemistry - with applications in drug design, protein synthesis etc. 
4. The Universe! - Richard Feynman famously quipped that nature is quantum and that any  successful model of nature must incorporate quantum effects, which quantum computing essentially involves.

## Quantum Machine Learning

Researchers often cast quantum and classical computing methods into the following four blocks, based on the classical/quantum nature of the data generating system and the data processing device.

### Classical Classical (CC)

This would typically correspond to classical data used in classical processing devices and would fall under standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning model. Using quantum-theory inspired ML models also fall under this category.

### Quantum Classical (QC)

Here machine learning methods are used to derive insights on quantum measurement data, or in learning phase-transitions in many-body systems, etc. Several experimental and computational data generated by quantum processes can be studied using classical devices. 

### Classical Quantum (CQ)

CQ and QQ are used synonymously with *quantum machine learning*. In CQ, one uses classical data such as time series variables or sales data or text or images and uses specially designed quantum algorithms to solve ML problems. These could either be supervised learning problems or even unsupervised learning methods that perform computationally complex tasks with ease. 

### Quantum Quantum (QQ)

In physics and chemistry, one often wishes to simulate dynamics of a system that is inherently quantum mechanical in nature. When quantum computers are used in the generation/simulation of quantum mechanical system we refer to it as QQ.

### Quantum Machine Learning Models

We know from *(classical)* Machine Learning that a parameterized model can be represented by $ f (x;\theta)$. Here, $x$ is the some data input to the model.
