These are notes from a podcast by Joscha Bach available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM). 

**The definition of nerd.**

> Nerds need to interface with the society in non-standard ways. Sometimes, I define a nerd as someone who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer-review. Normal people understand that the purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment and these purposes tend to conflict often.

> Whatever hapless individual is around you tend to make them, the gift of information. 

**On Nietzhe**

> Nietzhe is the modern equivalent of a shitposter.
