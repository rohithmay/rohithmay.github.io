### What is the optimal way of writing in 2020?

This question was the cause of much trouble and personal consternation in the past month. For a good part of last year, I've been writing reports and making lecture notes exclusively in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), with [TeXstudio](https://texstudio.org/) as my editor. What but LaTeX to create documents of exquisite beauty, captivating the academia since the '80s! Obviously, there is no match for LaTeX, *or is there?*

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

While LaTeX perfectly caters the needs of the academia especially when it comes to citation and math equations; the 40-year old typesetting program does fall short on versatility. This is largely due to the fact that LaTeX produces .pdf outputs and the pdf format, despite being good for reading, printing and sharing content, isn't suited well for web-based platforms of our age. Not to mention that most TeX editors of today have a GUI that certainly feels outdated.


### In search of text editors and word processors

So my quest began in search of a better user-experience for writing in LaTeX. I tried several editors such as [TeXstudio](https://texstudio.org/) and [TeXmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/), word-processors such as [TeXmacs](http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html) and [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/). At one point I even resorted to using MS Word, with a custom-made template based on LaTeX font [Computer Modern](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern), crafted just so it would look *tex-y* and would save me from having to write on lacklustre editors. Of course, I also tried the online editors such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/).  While I've already mentioned that the text editors and word processors feel like they are from a decade ago (and not in a good way), working on the online editors felt sub-optimal, given the high bar set by [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) for collaboration. Further, I also considered writing on Markdown, which appears to popular among people who wish to publish their writing online because of its easy convertibility to other formats - .html, .pdf, .docx or even .tex. And this opens up a wide array of markdown editors such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Typora](https://typora.io/).

### Motives

It was during this process that I pondered the objectives of doing the work I do and the report I make. Fun! Interest! Work! are all legitimate reasons. But deep down, there's the desire to communicate and share the work and its outcomes. Work is often a primer for conversation, I've observed. It's especially fun in those happy dispositions when you share the details of a tricky problem you got stuck in and how you made a mess solving it, and obsessed over it for days until you finally were successful and ended up where you desired; or even tragically the solution still eludes you. *It is fun*. There in stems the idea of publishing one's work sets it. What better way than to set up a site for oneself.


### Conditions for optimality

I enlisted my writing needs of today. And any editor, software, platform or process that enables these criteria would be optimal.

- Versatility in format, that is the ability to convert to any format such as pdf for publishing, tex for setting the journal-article like standards and other details typesetting, html for publishing on the web and interactivity, and docx just for the sake of it.
- Clean and minimalistic design of the editor interface, with shortcut methods and input options for tables, images, math and code blocks. Excessive formatting options can also be counter-productive. A [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) (what you see is what you mean) editor strikes an optimal balance amongst the host of [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) and WYSIYM (..your markup) editors.
- Aesthetic output format, preferably in fonts such as Computern Modern Serif and Sans Serif, with neat spacing and typesetting.
- Support for academic writing, especially when it comes to citations, footnotes and mathematical derivations; and proper numbering and internal references.
- Support for coding and even compiling the code, or display the outputs of precompiled code. With the ability to host formats such as .ipynb and .Rmd.
- Ability to collaborate with peers during the process of content-creating, with facility to comment and cross-reference.
- Hosting and publishing needs with a user-friendly web-platform and a git-based source-code. Ability to customize various aspects of the website, which include and are not limited to themes, fonts, stylesheets, math-support, commenting etc.

Needless to say, there is not one good *process* or *platform* that embodies all the above requirements. While Google provides enormous document collarboration the best. Github is great in maintain git-based repositories and on an editor like atom with teletype package, seamless collaboration in coding is possible. LaTeX is still the best typesetting platform for math, although markdown is well-suited for the web and editors such as Typora make the switch to the former really easy. MS Office of course is still the go-to platform for the masses, with legit reasons too. Where Overleaf fails, Authorea picks up, but is however priced and not an open-source platform. When it comes to hosting your website there's Jekyll and Hugo that make web development based on css3 and html5. There is not one platform; yet. But with a customized integrated process, one can make all the above requirements come through. And that's the story of this blog's inception.
