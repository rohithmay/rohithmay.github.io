The statistical modeling of macroeconomics involves varaibles with time-series data. Time series econometrics is concerned with the estimation of difference equations that contain stochastic components. The dynamic economic models use stochastic difference equations in order to forecast variables. Usually it is possible to decompose time-series data into *trend, cyclical (or seasonal)* and *irregular* components. The trend component refers to the long term behaviour of the series. The cyclical component is the periodic regular movements in the series. The stochastic component is the irregular component and our goal is usually to predict this component.
