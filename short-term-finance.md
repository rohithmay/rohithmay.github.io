# Short Term Finance

Short term finance concerns with the analysis of decisions that affect *current assets* and *current liabilities.* It deals with working capital management, where the cash flows occur within the timespan of 1 year.

### Questions

1. How much credit should you offer? (you == firm).
2. How much cash should you have at hand?
3. How much should you borrow for short term?
4. What is your cash management strategy in terms of a crisis?

**Definition.** *Current assets* are cash and other assets that are expected to be converted to cash within the year. In the Balance Sheet, they are shown in the order of liquidity, which is the ease of convertibility to cash. Items: *cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories*.

**Definition.** *Current Liabilities* are short term debts payable within a year. Items: *accounts payable, expenses payable (including accrued wages & tax), notes payable.*

> Net working Capital + Fixed Assets = Long-term Debt + Equity
